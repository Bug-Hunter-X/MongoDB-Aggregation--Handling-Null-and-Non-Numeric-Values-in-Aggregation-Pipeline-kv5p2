# MongoDB Aggregation Error: Handling Null and Non-Numeric Values
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines and provides a solution. The error occurs when aggregating data with fields that contain null values or non-numeric values when a numeric operation is expected. This leads to incorrect results such as incorrect averages or counts.
## Bug Description
The `$avg` operator in the aggregation pipeline skips null values; `$sum` does not complain about non-numeric values, but the calculation may be wrong.  This can result in inaccurate results when processing data with inconsistent data types.
